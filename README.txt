Task 1 - Implementing parts of TLS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Everything has been implemented according to the assignment description
and the specification of TLS 1.2. All given tests run successfully
without any errors.



Task 2 - Lucky13
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The attack has a few problems on my laptop (timings flunctuate), but on
my PC everything works perfectly.
NOTE: tls/challenges/its2016g41-018.rchal.sol has been recovered from heap
and is missing some characters in the beginning



Task 3 - Blockchain
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Due to exams and other exercises we did not have time to implement the
attack itself. We only implemented the Merkle Tree and the Blockchain.
