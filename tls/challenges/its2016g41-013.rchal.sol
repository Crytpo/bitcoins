the time", he thought, "it makes you stupid.
You've got to get enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury.
For instance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning to copy
out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their
breakfasts. I ought to just try that with my boss; I'd get kicked out on the
spot. But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I didn't have
my parents to think about I'd have given in my notice a long time ago, I'd have
gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him everything I would,
let him know just what I feel. He'd fall right off his desk! And it's a funny
sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your
subordinates from up there, especially when you have to go right up close
because the boss is hard of hearing. Well, there's still some hope; once I've
got the money together to pay off my parents' debt to him - another five or six
years I suppose - that's definitely what I'll do. That's when I'll make the big
change. First of all though, I've got to get up, my train leaves at five." And
he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers. "God in
Heaven!" he thought. It was half past six and the hands were quietly moving
forwards, it was even later than half past, more like quarter to seven. Had the
alarm clock not rung? He could see from the bed that it had been set for four
o'clock as it should have been; it certainly must have rung. Yes, but was it
possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had
not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What
should he do now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch that he
would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed,
and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and lively. And even if he did
catch the train he would not avoid his boss's anger as the office assistant
would have been there to see the five o'clock train go, he would have put in his
report about Gregor's not being there a long time ago. The office assistant was
the boss's man, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he reported
sick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of
service Gregor had never once yet been ill. His boss would certainly come round
with the doctor from the medical insurance company, accuse his parents of having
a lazy son, and accept the doctor's recommendation not to make any claim as the
doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what's
more, would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in fact, apart
from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel completely well and
even felt much hungrier than usual. One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from
troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.
He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see
his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The
bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any
