alarm clock not rung? He could see from the bed that it had been set for four
o'clock as it should have been; it certainly must have rung. Yes, but was it
possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had
not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. Wha7L¶]_ê³õe do now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch that he
would have to rush like mad and the collection of °VÌ°—û9¼ıtill not packed,

catch the train he would not avoid his boss's anger as the office assistant
would have been there to see the five o'clock train go, he would have put in his
report about Gregor's not being there a long time ago. The office assistant was
the boss's man, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he reported
sick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of
service Gregor had never once yet been ill. His boss wop%­ıõâ:inly come round
with the doctor from th medical insurance company, accuse his parents of having
a lazy son, and accept the doctor's recommendation not to make any claim as the
doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what's
more, would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in fact, apart
from excessive sleepinÑ® after sleepig for so long, feel completely well and
even felt much hungrier than usual. One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from
troubled dreams, he found €‘âelf transformed in his bed ie•­£Òšrible vermin.
He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head`.Æ2Pø	le he could see
his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The
bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.

between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out
on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a
picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine a%æoôz¸d in a
nøéz³ßy©èá_ame. It showed a l—RË°vG}(é, with a fur hat and fur boa who
sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm

weather. Drops of rain could be heard hittæ?²ÖØHfıí¥é which made him feel
quite sad. "HooÂ7<H^if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this
